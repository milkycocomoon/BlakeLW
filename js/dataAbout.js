From playing guitar for hours every day, to spending countless hours trying to level up my audio engineering knowledge. I've dedicated myself to creating the best music that I can, and create the best mixes that I can achieve.<br><br> Now that I'm where I'm comfortable, I want to help others make their dreams become a reality.`,

Or don't make the cut for my band!<br><br> My passion behind this project is what projected my growth not just in music writing, but mixing and mastering as a whole. An excuse for me to "get good" as they say. This is the project that ended up bringing me to light, and I hold it quite dearly.`,
